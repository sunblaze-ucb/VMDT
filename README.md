# VMDT

This repo contains the source code of VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust). This research endeavor is designed to help researchers and practitioners better understand the capabilities, limitations, and potential risks involved in deploying these state-of-the-art Video Foundation Models (VFMs). 


This benchmark is organized around the following five key perspectives of trustworthiness:
1. Safety
2. Hallucination
3. Fairness
4. Privacy
5. Adversarial robustness

## Project Structure

This project is structured around subdirectories dedicated to each area of trustworthiness. Each subdir includes scripts, data, and a dedicated README for easy comprehension.

## Dataset 

Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmfm-trust/T2V, https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmfm-trust/V2T 

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/VMDT.git 
```

Each folder describes the instruction to evaluate model.
