            EvaluationType.OBJECT: f"""
Object Detection Rules:

1. Visibility Requirements:
   - Must be clearly identifiable with defining features visible
   - Partial visibility acceptable if identity is unambiguous
   - Both location and identity must be clear

2. Reasoning Structure:
   - Walk through each object in the prompt.
   - Try to find a match in the frame description. Be flexible with object names.

Example Reasoning:
"**Prompt:** Red and green apples are spread on a table as part of a fruit arrangement next to a beautiful vase.

**Associated Description:** There is a brown wooden table with four sturdy legs and a smooth surface. A red fruit, likely an apple or tomato, with a slight shine is placed on the table. Additionally, two white plastic chairs are situated on either side of the table. In the background, a green potted plant is placed, and a window with white curtains is visible.

**Reasoning:** We will first walk through each object in the prompt and compare it to the description:
- **Table:** The description explicitly mentions a 'brown wooden table', matching the prompt's requirement for a table.
- **Vase:** There is no mention of a vase or anything resembling it in the description, indicating that the vase is not present in the frame. Therefore, the vase is not visible.
- **Apple** The description mentions a 'red fruit', which is likely an apple or tomato. Since the prompt specifies red apples, we can confidently say that the red fruit is an apple.

            EvaluationType.ATTRIBUTE: f"""
Attribute Evaluation Rules:

1. Attribute Visibility:
   - The visibility of each attribute must be clearly discernible and identified.
   - Material properties (e.g., wooden): Must see clear texture/material indicators
   - Colors: Must account for lighting conditions
   - Size relationships: Need reference objects or context
   - State (e.g., open/closed): Must see relevant parts

2. Reasoning Structure:
   - Walk through each object in the prompt.
     - For each attribute belonging to the object, verify its presence in the description.

Example Reasoning:
"**Prompt:** A video of a brown wooden table with a red vase and a plastic lamp with a brown shade.

**Associated Description:** There is a brown wooden table with a visibly smooth and glossy surface, indicating it is polished. On the table, there is a red ceramic vase with intricate floral patterns. The vase reflects the ambient lighting, highlighting its glossy finish. Additionally, a metal lamp with a beige shade is placed next to the vase.

**Reasoning:** We will walk through each object, then each attribute of said object, and compare them to the prompt:
- **Table:** The description mentions a 'brown wooden table', which matches the prompt's requirement for a table.
  Attributes:
    - **Material (Wooden):** The description confirms that the table is made of wood, as it is a 'brown wooden table.'
    - **Color (Brown):** The table is described as brown, aligning with the prompt's requirement.
- **Vase:** The description mentions a 'vase', matching the prompt's requirement for a vase.
  Attributes:
    - **Color (Red):** The description specifies a 'red ceramic vase,' which aligns with the prompt's requirement.
    - **Material (Ceramic):** The vase is made of ceramic, as stated in the description.
- **Lamp:** The description mentions a 'metal lamp', matching the prompt's requirement for a lamp.
  Attributes:
    - **Color (Brown):** The lamp has a beige shade, as mentioned in the description. Since beige is a shade of brown, this attribute aligns with the prompt's requirement.
    - **Material (Plastic):** The lamp is made of metal, as stated in the description. However, the prompt specifies a plastic lamp, which is not visible in the frame.
""",

            EvaluationType.SPATIAL: f"""
Spatial Relation Rules:

1. Positional Analysis:
   - Describe spatial relations among objects thoroughly, using clear spatial terms.
   - Never assume an object in the prompt is in the frame if not visible.
   - Ensure positions are clear using relative terms such as "next to", "above", or "below".

2. Depth Relations:
   - Depth markers are used to represent the distance each object is from the viewer:
     - Depth 0%: Closest.
     - Depth 100%: Farthest.
   - Rules for depth comparisons:
     - Closer/Farther from Viewpoint:
       - "Closer to viewpoint": ANY part of A must be nearer than ALL parts of B.
       - "Farther from viewpoint": ALL parts of A must be farther than ALL parts of B.
     - Use visual aids (overlap, shadows, perspective lines) to confirm.

3. Multiple Instance Handling:
   - Positional rules apply to ALL instances unless specified otherwise in the prompt.
     - e.g., for "left of," ALL instances of A must be left of ALL instances of B; for "above," ALL instances of A must be above ALL instances of B.
   - Document any exceptions explicitly.
     - e.g., if the prompt is "One of the dogs is left of a cat," we only require one dog to be left of the cat, not all dogs.

4. Confidence Levels:
   - For each spatial relation, select one of the provided options or "Unable to Determine."
   - Provide a confidence level for your selection.

5. Reasoning Structure:
    - Walk through each relation in the evaluation target. See if the description matches the prompt by clearly stating the positions of each object, if present.
    - Only analyze the relations indicated in the evaluation target.
      - Analyze horizontal relations (left of/right of) by clearly situating each object relative to each other.
      - Analyze vertical relations (above/below) by clearly situating each object relative to each other.
      - Confirm depth relations using markers and visual cues.

Example Reasoning:
"**Prompt:** A dog is playing left of a bone in the forest, and the dog is below the bone. The dog is closer to the camera than the bone, having fun playing.

**Associated Description:** A brown dog is sitting on the green grass. A bone is located nearby. There is also a tall oak tree in the vicinity.

**Reasoning:** 
The relations in the evaluation target are as follows: dog left of/right of bone, dog above/below bone, and dog closer to the camera than/farther from the camera than bone.
1. **Horizontal Relations:**
  Dog and Bone:
   - The dog is positioned more to the left than the bone.
   - Since the dog's position is to the left, the dog is 'left of' the bone with HIGH confidence.

2. **Vertical Relations:**
  Dog and Bone:
   - Despite varying positions, the dog is observed lower relative to the bone.
   - Thus, the dog is 'below' the bone with MEDIUM confidence.

3. **Depth Relations:**
  Dog and Bone:
   - The dog is clearly positioned closer to the viewer than the bone.
   - Therefore, the dog is 'closer to the camera' than the bone with HIGH confidence.
""",
            EvaluationType.SPATIAL_BBOX: f"""
Use the bounding boxes to determine the spatial relations based on the Spatial Relation Rules.

Spatial Relation Rules:
1. Horizontal and Vertical Relations:
    - For horizontal and vertical relations, use the bounding boxes to determine the positions of the objects relative to each other.
    - A bounding box that is more to the left than another bounding box is considered "left of" that bounding box.
        - Same for "right of" as well.
    - A bounding box that is higher than another bounding box is considered "above" that bounding box.
        - Same for "below" as well.

2. Depth Relations:
   - Depth markers are used to represent the distance each object is from the viewer:
     - Depth 0%: Closest.
     - Depth 100%: Farthest.
   - Rules for depth comparisons:
     - Closer/Farther from Viewpoint:
       - "Closer to viewpoint": ANY part of A must be nearer than ALL parts of B.
       - "Farther from viewpoint": ALL parts of A must be farther than ALL parts of B.
     - Use visual aids (overlap, shadows, perspective lines) to confirm.
     - Use the bounding boxes to isolate the objects. However, the bounding boxes alone will not provide depth information. You must use visual cues to determine depth relations.
       - In general, left/right/above/below relations are independent of depth, so should NOT be used to determine depth relations.

3. Multiple Instance Handling:
   - Positional rules apply to ALL instances unless specified otherwise in the prompt.
     - e.g., for "left of," ALL instances of A must be left of ALL instances of B; for "above," ALL instances of A must be above ALL instances of B.
   - Document any exceptions explicitly.
     - e.g., if the prompt is "One of the dogs is left of a cat," we only require one dog to be left of the cat, not all dogs.

4. Confidence Levels:
   - For each spatial relation, select one of the provided options or "Unable to Determine."
   - Provide a confidence level for your selection. If you are not sure the bounding boxes are accurate or the listed objects are in the image at all, say "Low Confidence."

5. Reasoning Structure:
    - Walk through each relation in the evaluation target. See if the description matches the prompt by clearly stating the positions of each object, if present.
    - Only analyze the relations indicated in the evaluation target.
      - Analyze horizontal relations (left of/right of) by clearly situating each object relative to each other.
      - Analyze vertical relations (above/below) by clearly situating each object relative to each other.

            EvaluationType.COUNT: f"""
Counting Rules:

1. Organized Counting:
   - Use a methodical approach to count the number of instances in the frame.
   - Clearly identify each object through distinctive features.

2. Instance Criteria:
   - Must be fully identifiable as distinct instances. If not, answer with 0.
   - Partial visibility acceptable if clearly separate
   - Group counting requires clear individual distinction

3. Confidence Levels:
   - State confidence level for final count.

4. Reasoning Structure:
   - Walk through each object in the prompt. Then, count each object based on its presence in the description.
   - Cross-reference object attributes with the prompt to ensure correct identification.
   - Provide a clear and systematic counting process.
   - Always respond with an integer count.

6. Example Reasoning:
"**Prompt:** A video of a table with a shining tablecloth and 3 apples sitting on it. The window is open next to the scene, providing a much needed breeze.

**Associated Description:** There are three fruits on the brown wooden table: two red and one green. They are either apples or tomatoes. Additionally, there are two yellow bananas hanging from the table's edge. There is one blue vase that is empty.

**Reasoning:** 
- **Identification:**
  Apples:
  - The fruits are either apples or tomatoes. Since the prompt specifies counting apples, we assume they are apples.
  - The apples are clearly visible and distinguishable by color.

- **Counting Process:**
  - Two red apples are present.
  - One green apple is present.
  - Total apples on the table: 3

- **Verification:**
  - No other objects in the description match the prompt's criteria for apples.
  - The bananas and vase are irrelevant to the apple count.

""",

            EvaluationType.ACTION: f"""
Action Recognition Rules:

1. Action Verification:
   - Must see clear evidence of action in progress.
   - Consider required body positions/movements.
   - Look for interaction between subjects/objects.

2. Confidence Levels:
   - For each action, provide existence (True/False) and a confidence level.

3. Reasoning Structure:
   - Walk through each action in the prompt. Then, analyze the sequence of frames to determine the consistency and progression of the supposed actions.
   - Provide detailed reasoning that links observed motions to the actions specified in the prompt.
   - IMPORTANT: You need to actually see the action happening, not just predict it is reasonable to happen.

5. Example Reasoning:
"**Prompt:** A person is dressed in a blue shirt and jeans throwing a ball in the park.

**Associated Description:** In frame 1, a person is standing near a brown wooden table. In frame 2, the person begins to raise their left hand, while their right hand remains on the table. In frame 3, the person's left hand is fully extended above their head, and in frame 4, the person swiftly moves their left hand forward, suggesting the motion of throwing an object. Throughout the frames, the person's posture remains consistent, with no visible artifacts disrupting the motion sequence.

**Reasoning:** 
- **Action Identification:**
  Throwing a Ball:
  - Frame 1: Person is stationary.
  - Frame 2: Initiation of movement by raising the left hand.
  - Frame 3: Full extension of the left hand.
  - Frame 4: Swift forward motion of the left hand, indicating a throwing action.
  - Frame 5: Ball is separated from the hand, suggesting a throw.

- **Consistency with Prompt:**
  - The sequential movement from raising the hand to throwing aligns with the action of throwing a ball as specified in the prompt.
  - No discrepancies or irrelevant actions are observed. We see the ball in motion, indicating a successful throw.

- **Final Assessment:**
  - The progression of arm movement across frames strongly indicates the action of throwing.
